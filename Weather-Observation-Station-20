*/

-- Solution:
-- equating two subqueries that count the number of variables smaller than the median and those larger than thev median value 
under WHERE clause.


SELECT ROUND((S.LAT_N),4) MEDIAN FROM STATION S
WHERE 
(SELECT COUNT(LAT_N)FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N > S.LAT_N) = 
(SELECT COUNT(LAT_N)FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N < S.LAT_N);
